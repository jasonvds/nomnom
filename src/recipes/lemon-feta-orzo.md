Cook the orzo in salted water until al dente. 

*Note: the water should be as salty as the sea as it's your only chance to flavor the orzo.*

Salt the water after it comes to a boil, stir, and add in the orzo.

In the meantime, work on the dressing by adding olive oil, lemon juice and zest, dill, mustard, salt, and pepper to a glass measuring cup. 

Stir until fully combined.

Add the cooked orzo to a large bowl, and, while still warm, pour the dressing on top and stir. 

Crumble in some feta (measure with your heart) and stir again.
