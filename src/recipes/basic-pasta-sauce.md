In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 

Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft and light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. 

Season with salt. 

Add the thyme, red pepper flakes, if desired, and carrots and cook 5 minutes more, until carrot is quite soft. 

Add the tomatoes and juice and bring to a boil, stirring often. 

Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes until as thick as hot cereal. 

Season with salt. 

Sauce holds 1 week in the refrigerator or up to 6 months in the freezer.
