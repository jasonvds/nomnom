Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon of salt. Set up an ice bath nearby. 

Cook the couscous in the boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain and immediately plunge it into the ice bath. 

Once cooled, remove and set aside to dry on a plate.

In a 12- to 14-inch sauté pan, heat the olive oil until just smoking. 

Add the pine nuts, currants, and red pepper flakes, if desired, and sauté until the nuts are just golden brown, about 2 minutes. 

Add the caperberries, tomato sauce, wine, and couscous and bring to a boil. 

Add the calamari and scallion whites, stir to combine, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the calamari is just cooked and completely opaque. 

Season with salt and pepper, drizzle with olive oil, pour into a large bowl, sprinkle with scallion greens, and serve immediately.
